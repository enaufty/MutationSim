# ðŸ§¬ DNA Mutation Simulator

This project is a basic genetic simulator developed in Python utilizing the `random` library. It generates a random DNA sequence of a specified length and applies a predefined number of **point mutations (substitutions)** to that sequence.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Random DNA Generation:** Creates random DNA sequences of a specified length (e.g., 50 bases).
* **Point Mutation:** Applies single base changes (Aâ†’T, Câ†’G, etc.) at random positions along the sequence.
* **Comparison Report:** Compares the original and mutated sequences to report all changes on a position-by-position basis.
